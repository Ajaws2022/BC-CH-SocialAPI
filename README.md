# Mock Social Network Using Mongo/Mongoose and Express

For this bootcamp challenge we were tasked with creating a mock social network using the models of Users, Friends, Thoughts, and Reactions. It was a unique task as it was my first experience building an API without SQL. A demo video can be found by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HdKRUpGVf4KdTWP47axtEl5CneOlCiGH/view).

## Installation
To install use your preferred method provided by GitHub. Node is required. Once inside of the repo open it locally in a terminal or bash then run npm install to install the necessary packages.

## Usage

To use the application first run node utils/seed to populate a basic set of data either node server.js or your preffered runtime environment on the same file. Open it locally in a REST client. From there the routes can be accesed using localhost:3001/api/ and "/users" or "/thoughts" following the api call. Each has a similar but unique set of queries that can be viewed in the "routes/api/thoughtRoutes.js or /userRoutes.js".
